When playing game, entering coordinates;
If you type SAVE filename, it saves the board to filename.
If you type LOAD filename, it loads the board from filename.
If you type MENU, it returns to main menu.
If you type COMPARE, it lists you all existing games and you choose one of them.

In menu, you can start a new game, continue to an existing game or exit. You can create a new game as much as you want. I printed my static filled_cell_count variable in menu.

My play() function for computer takes parameters. (I asked you the validity of this through e-mail but you did not answer).

I used friend to reach Cell's data with Hex public methods. Actually just for reaching to static member filled_cell_count.
